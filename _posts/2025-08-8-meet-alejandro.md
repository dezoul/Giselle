**Meet our head chef, Antoine Darquin**

**Tell me about yourself and your background?**

I’m Antoine Darquin — a French kid who was supposed to become a physical trainer, rebelled, and ended up in kitchen instead. My culinary journey began in Lyon and Paris, where chefs yelled more than they spoke… and somehow, I fell in love with the energy there. I got the opportunity to learn beside incredible Michelin star chef. From there, I travelled kitchens across France and Asia, always chasing flavor over fame. I opened Bisou Bangkok to bring a slice of that soulful, unpretentious, kiss of French indulgence to Bangkok.

**What cuisines or styles have influenced your cooking the most?**

French roots first — But over the years, Mediterranean generosity, Japanese precision, and punchiness snuck into my DNA. My style today is what I call “naughty bistro” — technique-driven cooking with a playful spirit and zero snobbism.

**Tell me about the exciting new project, Giselle?**

Giselle is our new restaurant located in Bali, she’s inspired by the Mediterranean seaside lifestyle — think long lunches, fresh catch, feet in the sand, and dishes that taste like summer flings feel: unforgettable but never too serious.

**How would you describe the concept and culinary identity of the restaurant?**

Giselle is a Mediterranean seafood playground. Fresh, local fish from Bali’s coast cooked with European creativity and simplicity. It’s not about reinventing the wheel — it’s about reminding people how damn good the wheel tastes when the product is top and the vibe is honest. Casual elegance with a bit of cheek.

**What sets this restaurant apart from others in the area?**

We don’t do “fusion” to be trendy. We do clarity of flavour, exceptional sourcing, and a warm atmosphere where you’re treated like a regular even on your first visit. It’s a restaurant with a soul (and a little attitude). Our secret sauce? We cook like we’re inviting you to our home — except the wine is colder and the music is better.

**Tell us about the menu and how it was created?**

The menu was born from the fresh catch and French savoir-faire. The idea: let the product speak — don’t shout over it. Every dish is three things: seasonal, sexy, and shareable. Because food tastes better when you steal it off someone else’s plate.

**What excites you the most about Giselle?**

Honestly? The energy. It’s a restaurant you feel before you even taste it. And the challenge of bringing Michelin-level mentality into a relaxed vibes — that contrast is thrilling. Plus, watching people fall in love with simple things done right…

**Can you share one or two dishes you’re most excited for people to try?**

The Sea Bream Sashimi, Yuzukosho Vinaigrette, dressed directly on the fish bones with citrus Yuzukoshol and our whole roasted Pink Snapper in Salt Crust, Beurre Blanc Noily Prat.

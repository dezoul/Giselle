Last weekend, Canggu got a little hotter.

Bali's food scene is, in my humble opinion one of the best in the world, in Canggu might just have the highest density of incredibly food within just a few kilometers. So when a new restaurant opens up, you know it has to be good - really good - to make an impact on the dining scene here. So with some serious hospitality experience behind the team at Giselle (with each of the founders having run award-winning restaurants in Bangkok before their move to Bali) I was excited to try it for myself.

The long-awaited opening of Giselle Bali saw a crowd that was equal parts glamorous, curious, and unashamedly hungry. Between clinking glasses, stolen bites, and that golden-hour glow over the rice fields, the tone for this restaurant’s future was set — effortlessly sexy, a little wild, and unmistakably French.

Helmed by Executive Chef Antoine Darquin (of Bisou Bangkok fame), Giselle’s menu flirts shamelessly between Mediterranean freshness and Parisian precision. Think crudo kissed with citrus, charred octopus with smoky paprika, and slow-cooked lamb so tender it should come with a warning label.

The drinks list? Dangerous. A mix of Mediterranean wines, signature cocktails that taste like holiday romance, and just enough bubbles to make the night stretch longer than planned.

It’s rare to find a restaurant that nails both the vibe and the flavour. Giselle manages it with ease — thanks to a team that’s clearly obsessed with the details. From the playlist to the plating, everything feels considered but never forced.

If the opening weekend was any sign, Canggu’s newest Mediterranean restaurant isn’t here to play nice. It’s here to play.

A taste of what’s to come? Expect evenings that start at sunset and end somewhere between the last sip of Negroni and the first hint of sunrise.
